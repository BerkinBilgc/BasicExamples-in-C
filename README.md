Basic C examples.
Note: My operating system is 64 bit. Some question may be different. This may be due to different operating system.
First of all you check your operating system than you try this codeblocks.

1) Write that how many byte of data types have and the minimum and maximum values its can take.

2) Write the number of bytes of the following pointer types.
a.	char *
b.	unsigned char *
c.	int *
d.	unsigned int *

3) You need to do bitwise operation.
Your init value is : 
int val = 0xCAFE
a. Check if LSB first bit is 1
b. Modify 0xCAFE to 0xCAF

4) Create a function that accepts 3 arguments. The function print that which number closest to 80

5) Print 20 lines of * characters on the screen. There should be 20 stars in the first line, and the number of stars should decrease by one in each subsequent line.

6) Define an array with 1000 elements.This start with 0 and constantly increase 1. 
For example: 
0,1,2,3,4...
Then collect all list elements and print.

7) Create array of 10 elements. Print the smallest and largest value in the array.

8)  Point to the variable with an integer pointer and assign a new value to the variable via the pointer. 
Print the addresses shown and indicated by the pointer to the screen. Increase the pointer by one. Print the address shown by the pointer to the screen.

9) Create a node. Then enter how many nodes you want to create. Print this created structure from the beginning to the end and then from the end to the beginning.

First input(How many node will there be): 3
Node1:1
Node2:4
Node3:6

Output1: 1 4 6

Output2: 6 4 1
